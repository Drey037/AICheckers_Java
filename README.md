# Checkers AI (Java)
Welcome to the Checkers AI program written in Java! This program allows you to play a game of checkers against an AI opponent, where you control the red pieces and the AI controls the white pieces. The game is played on the command line interface.

## Getting Started
To get started, you'll need to compile and run the Main.java file. You can do this by navigating to the directory containing the source files and executing the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:


```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```

This will compile the Java source code and run the program, initiating a game of checkers where you play against the AI opponent.

## Gameplay Instructions
### Red Pieces:
You control the red pieces, and your goal is to capture all of the white pieces or block them from moving.
### White Pieces:
The AI controls the white pieces, and its objective is to capture all of your red pieces or block them from moving.
### Move Input:
To move a piece, you'll need to input the coordinates of the piece you want to move (x, y), followed by the coordinates of the destination square (x, y). For example, to move a piece from position (2, 3) to position (3, 4), you would input 2 3 3 4.
